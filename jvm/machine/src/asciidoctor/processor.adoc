== Processor Structures

The programs of the mm-ADT virtual machine are *types*.
From a set of canonical types (_ctypes_), derived types (_dtypes_) of arbitrary complexity can be constructed using instructions from the VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture].
Every mm-ADT type has a corresponding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)[diagrammatic] representation that is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism[isomorphic] to a directed labeled *type graph* composed of _type_-vertices and _instruction_-edges.

A program's type graph is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation[intermediate representation] used by the mm-ADT VM to not only link types (encode), but also to compile them (transform/optimize).
At execution time, values propagate through the type graph and generate a parallel, homomorphic image of the types as values in the *value graph*, where the resultant structure of an mm-ADT computation is the *obj graph*, where

\[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{q}) + (\texttt{value} \times \texttt{q}).
\]

Type composition, compilation, and evaluation are carried out by mm-ADT compliant *processors*.
Processors ground the mm-ADT VM to the underlying physical computer (whether on a single machine, via multiple threads, or across compute cluster), where, at the bottom of this _process stack_, the natural world's physics provides the baseline dynamics (the fundamental ground of the computation).

This section details the specifics of the relationships between types, values, and processors.

=== Processes

Processors are used in the following three situations:

. *Composition*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference[type inference]).
. *Compilation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization[type optimization]). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_%28mathematics%29[fix point]).
. *Evaluation*: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)[type enumeration]).

=== Algebraic Actions

A thread of execution in the VM maintains two primary references: 1.) a reference to an `obj` and 2.) a reference to an `inst`.
Via the juxtaposition of `obj` and `inst` another `obj` is realized.
When a VM process refers to the `obj` \$a\$ and the instruction `inst` \$i\$, then the VM will perform one of the following operations:

. If the vertex \$a\$ has no outgoing \$i\$-labeled edge, then the VM _applies_ \$a\$ to \$i\$ to yield the edge \$a \to_i b\$ and arrive at \$b\$ (*compute*).
. If the vertex \$a\$ has an outgoing \$i\$-labeled edge, then the VM _traverses_ the edge \$a \to_i b\$ to arrive at \$b\$ (*memoize*).

The first situation is computing via function https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy[evaluation] (save space).
The second situation leverages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization[memoization] to avoid recomputing (save time).
These two situations offer three high-level perspectives on the `obj` graph.

. *Mathematically*: The `obj` graph has an infinite number of `obj` vertices connected to each other by edges labeled from the infinite https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] `inst`.
From this perspective, computing is traversal (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table[look-up]) as the `obj` graph is fully materialized.
. *Theoretically*: The `obj` graph is manifested as computations proceed where, if \$a \in \tt{obj}\$ and \$i \in \tt{i\nst}\$, then any binary operation \$ai\$ that has already been evaluated already exists in the `obj` graph and as such, can be traversed.
. *Physically*: The `obj` graph is a dynamic entity that expands and contracts given the resource constraints of the underlying physical machines supporting its manifestation across all levels of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy[memory hierarchy], where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)[garbage collection] prunes the graph and computation grows the graph.

==== Type Specification

An mm-ADT *program* in an mm-ADT *type*.
In the type graph (a subgraph of the `obj` graph) a type is denoted by a vertex (an _ungrounded_ vertex).
That vertex is the type's *range*.
The type's *definition* is encoded in the directed, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_automaton[deterministic] path that ends at a vertex with no outgoing edges.
The resultant vertex is a _root_ vertex and is the type's *domain*.
If the type definition's path length is 0, then the domain and the range are equal, and the type is a ctype (a canonical type).
If the path length is greater than 0, then the directed binary edges of the path are labeled with instructions from `inst`.
This construction is abstractly represented in the diagram below.


image::../processor/type-path.png[align=center,width=800]

The type graph forms the central structure upon by which various VM processes are enacted.
These processes include type/program specification, compilation, optimization, and ultimately, via a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism[homomorphism] from the type graph to the value graph, evaluation.
Given finite computing resources, the type graph does not exist eternally in a static form ready-made.
No, instead, subgraphs of it must be generated.
This is accomplished via an action of `inst` monoid on the set `inst^*^` (the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star[Kleene star] closure of `inst`).
For instance, in `mmlang` the user juxtaposes a ctype (domain) and an `inst` to construct a dtype.
That dtype is juxtaposed with another `inst` to yield another dtype so forth until a desired type is reached.

\[
\texttt{range} = ((((((\texttt{domain} \cdot \texttt{inst}_0) \cdot \texttt{inst}_1) \cdot \texttt{inst}_2) \ldots) \cdot \texttt{inst}_{n-2}) \cdot \texttt{inst}_{n-1}).
\]

In general, the action of an `inst` on a type is the function \[
\texttt{inst}: T \to T, \]
where if \$a \in \tt{i\nst}\$, then \[
a(x) = xa.
\]

Said plainly, instructions in `inst` act on types by concatenating themselves to the type definition.
Thus, algebraically, a type is an element of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_algebra[free] inst monoid rooted at a ctype.

==== Type Compilation

==== Type Optimization

==== Type Evaluation

A type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiles] a type.
A type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable[evaluates] a value.
The `inst` monoid's *type specification* action yields an element in the free `inst` monoid, which, in the `obj` graph, is realized as a path from a range vertex to a domain vertex.
In the example `obj` graph encoding below, the range vertex is the *type path*'s _source_ and the domain vertex is the path's _target_.

image::../processor/type-path.png[align=center,width=800]

During *type evaluation*, the type path is reversed to form the *co-type path*, where the domain vertex is the source and the range vertex is the target.

image::../processor/co-type-path.png[align=center,width=800]

If \$x \in \tt{value}\$, then \$x\$ is propagated along the co-type path, where the \$\tt{domai\n}\$ and \$\tt{rang\e}\$ types perform https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information[runtime type checking] and the instructions transform the source \$x\$ value at each step into the resultant \$y\$ value.

\[
y = ((((((((x \cdot \texttt{domain}) \cdot \texttt{inst}_0) \cdot \texttt{inst}_1) \cdot \texttt{inst}_2) \ldots) \cdot \texttt{inst}_{n-2}) \cdot \texttt{inst}_{n-1}) \cdot \texttt{range}).
\]

<1> An `int\<=int` type with a type path length of 5.
<2> The co-type path of the previous type encoded in a `;-poly`.
<3> The step-wise `\=>` evaluation of the co-type path.
<4> The step-wise `\=>` evaluation of the co-type path chambered in a `;-poly`.
<5> The evaluation of the `;-poly` simply returns the last path value.

In the `mmlang` example above, the step-wise `\=>` evaluation of the co-type path is in one-to-one correspondence with the mm-ADT VM's execution plan.
The mm-ADT algebras are particular constraints on the most general algebraic specification of mm-ADT: the `obj` magma.
