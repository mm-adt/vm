== The Algebra

=== The Obj Monoid

The `obj` monoid is defined
\[
(\texttt{obj},=>,\mathbf{1},\mathbf{0}),
\]
where `obj` is the set of all quantified mm-ADT objects, \$ =>: \tt{obj} \times \tt{obj} \rightarrow \tt{obj}\$ the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property[associative] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation[binary] _juxtaposition_ operator (`[juxta]` \$\in\$ `inst`), \$\mathbf{1}\$ the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element[identity element] `\_{1}` (or simply `{1}`), and \$\mathbf{0}\$ is the annihilator `_{0}` (or simply `{0}`). Given that an `obj` is either a type or a value, \$=>\$ supports four https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function[argument] combinations.

For the two \$x => \tt{type}\$ argument patterns, the type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action[acts] on \$x\$ -- i.e., \$\tt{type}(x)\$.
The \$=>\$ operator is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function[higher order function], where the semantics of the application are in the type's definition. For instance, in the expression `'a' \=> str[plus,'b']`, `'a'` is being applied to `str[plus,'b']`, and only when `str[plus,'b']` acts on `'a'` is \$=>\$ full defined. Thus, the complexity of the `obj` monoid lies in the elements of its carrier set -- in particular, in the virtual machine's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] (`inst`).

The `obj` monoid's \$=>\$ operator is a sugar symbol denoting the instruction `[juxta]`. Furthermore, `[juxta]` is one of three mm-ADT instructions in `inst` that provide direct access to the underlying stream ring algebra where `[juxta]` is the `inst` denotation of the \$\ast\$-operator of the stream ring. With the \$+\$ and \$\oplus\$ operators being denoted in `inst` via `[branch]` and `[barrier]`, respectively, their exists an isomorphism between `obj` monoid and the stream ring.

\[
\begin{split}
a * b      \;\;\mapsto&\;\;  a \Rightarrow b          \\
a + b      \;\;\mapsto&\;\;  \texttt{[branch,(a,b)]}  \\
a \oplus b \;\;\mapsto&\;\;  \texttt{[a,b]} \Rightarrow \texttt{[barrier]} \\
\mathbf{1} \;\;\mapsto&\;\;  \mathbf{1}               \\
\mathbf{0} \;\;\mapsto&\;\;  \mathbf{0}
\end{split}
\]

=== The Inst Monoid



The mm-ADT virtual machine's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] (ISA) is denoted `inst` \$\subset\$ `obj`.
In `mmlang`, an `inst` is defined by the grammar fragment

[.text-center]
`inst  ::= '[' op(','obj)* ']' q?`,

where `op` is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode[opcode] from a predefined set of character string. Example opcodes include `plus`, `mult`, `branch`, `is`, `gt`, `lt`, etc. An mm-ADT program is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language[sequence of instructions] commonly known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode[bytecode]. While an mm-ADT program can be realized as a ring of types and values being added and multiplied, there is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_and_faithful_functors[faithful embedding] of this richer ring structure into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_monoid[syntactic monoid] called the `inst` monoid defined as
\[
(\texttt{inst}^\ast,\circ,\emptyset),
\]
where \$\circ:\tt{i\nst}^\ast \times \tt{i\nst}^\ast \to \tt{i\nst}^\ast\$ concatenates `inst` sequences and \$\emptyset\$ is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set[empty set] behaving as the identity element. An mm-ADT program is a type. In order to generate a type from a word of the free `inst` monoid, there exists a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism[homomorphism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler[assembler]) from the `inst` monoid to the previously defined `obj` monoid \$(\tt{obj},\Rightarrow,\mathbf{1},\mathbf{0})\$.

NOTE: Expressions of the form `-<(a,b,c)>-` are decomposed representations of `[a,b,c]`, where `-<(a,b,c)` _splits_, but does not _merge_.

As a ring, an mm-ADT `obj` can be multiplied or added to another `obj`.
Multiplication is denoted with `\=>` (`5 \=> int+2`) or simple term juxtaposition (`5+2`).
Addition, on the other hand, is realized by the `[branch]` instruction which has an `mmlang` sugar of `[,]`.
The way in which `obj` addition effects the `obj` graph is important.

2 => int[+4[is>0],*5]+1                                                     //<2>

----
<1> The `int`-dependent type clones the `int` to the two branches, merges the branch output, and adds `1` (*compilation*).
<2> `2` is propagated through the `int{1,2}\<=int` type (*evalution*).
<3> The path through the `obj` value graph taken by the resultant `objs`.
<4> The type of each resultant value.

The compilation of the `int{1,2}\<=int` type generates the path diagrammed below in the *type subgraph* of the `obj` graph.

image::obj-type-path-example.svg[width=625,align=center]

The evaluation of the type with the input of `2` generates two paths through the *value subgraph* of the `obj` graph -- via _split_ (\$\Delta\$) and _merge_ (\$\nabla\$).
Branching (addition) is one of two fundamental operations in the mm-ADT ring algebra.
It is not manifested as an `inst` in a value's path history.
Likewise, the other fundamental operation, `\=>` (multiplication) has no explicit `inst` and is denoted with juxtaposition in the value path history.
The significance of branching being fundamental in mm-ADT is that individual branches can evaluate in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel[decoupled], independent manner requiring no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)[synchronization] nor explicit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_%28computer_science%29[coordination] at merge.

.Process Architectures Sympathetic to the Type Ringoid
================================================================
An `mmlang` expression denotes a *type* (program) that is executed by a processor.
A type is an element of the *type ringoid* algebra.
The type ringoid is not the intended algebra of the language component.
The reason being, languages yield linear structures.
A linear medium is sympathetic to single operator https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)[magmas] such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoids] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)[groups].
In order to express addition (branching) in these structures, the parallel branches are serially embedded using the `[,]` syntactic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge#Computer_science[hack].

The *type* elements of the type ringoid are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space[three dimensional] structures (where the third dimension captures nesting) and have a more natural embedding in the spatial component of the physical world.
Computationally, types are evaluated by processors across a number of cores of a single machine and/or across a multi-machine compute cluster.
The type ringoid algebra yields types that are sympathetic to a variety of modern processor architectures.

==== Stream Module Axioms

.Modules
****
A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)[module] for a group \$(A,+\_A,\mathbf{0}_A)\$ is a ring \$(X, +_X ,\ast_X, \mathbf{0}_X, \mathbf{1}_X )\$ such that elements of \$X\$ act on elements of \$A\$ via a function \$\cdot: X \times A \to A\$ called *scalar multiplication*.
If \$A = X\$, the action is defined by the ring's multiplicative operator.
However, when \$A \ne X\$ and moreover, when \$A\$ and/or \$X\$ is free, a ring theoretic interpretation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra[linear algebraic] emerges with \$A\$-based vectors (free magma) and matrices (two free magmas) being operated by \$X\$ scalars, vectors, and matrices.
The axioms for both left and right modules are provided below, where if \$A\$ is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group[abelian group], then \$X\$ is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodule[bimodule] and both sets of axioms hold.

Modules introduce a new _scalar multiplication_ binary operator \$cdot: X \times A \to A\$ typically denoted as \$X\$/\$A\$-element juxtaposition.
In mm-ADT, the module expression \[
x \cdot (a + b) \mapsto (xa + xb) \]
is realized as \[
x \Delta (a + b) \mapsto (x=>a,x=>b).
\]
The \$\Delta\$ (_split_) copys an `obj` that is _outside_ of a `poly` to the left of one or more `objs` _inside_ the `poly`.
When juxtaposed to the left and an internal `obj`, the `obj` monoid's binary operator \$=>:\tt{obj} \times \tt{obj} \to \tt{obj}\$ determines the type/type, value/type, value/value, type/value resolution.
The following table provides a translation of the standard module axioms to mm-ADT.

===== Polynomials

NOTE: The reason for the `[split]` sugar symbol `-<`, is that it represents one wire (`-`) splitting into many (`<`).
Likewise, the reason for `>-` being the `[merge]` sugar symbol is it represents many wires merging (`>`) into one (`-`).
Finally, `[combine]` has a sugar of `=` which represents parallel wires being operated on independently.

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial[polynomial] is a _linear combination_ of _terms_ composed of _coefficients_ and _indeterminates_ typically expressed as \[
f(x) = q_1 x^1 + q_2 x^2 + q_3 x^3 + \ldots + q_n x^n, \]
where \$q_i\$ is a coefficient, \$x^i\$ is an indeterminate raised to the \$i^\text{th}\$ power, \$q_i x^i\$ is a term, and the terms are linearly combined via \$+\$.
If \$x \in \mathbb{Z}\$, then the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#Arrow_notation[signature] of \$f\$ is \$f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\$.
When \$f(x)\$ is evaluated with some \$x \in \mathbb{Z}\$, \$x\$ becomes determined and the polynomial is reduced to a single \mathbb{Z}.
For instance, \[
f(x) = 2x + 3x^2 + 6x^3 \]
is irreducible due to \$x\$ being an indeterminant variable.
If \$x =4\$, then the polynomial is solved via the reduction \[
\begin{split}
f(4) &= (2 \ast 4) + (3 \ast 4^2) + (6 \ast 4^3) \\ &= (2 \ast 4) + (3 \ast 16) + (6 \ast 64) \\ &= 8 + 48 + 384 \\ &= 440. \end{split}
\]

In mm-ADT, `poly` \$\subset\$ `obj` is the (infinite) set of polynomials.
The polynomial expression above is a `,-poly` \$\subset\$ `poly` (pronounced "comma poly") and, in `mmlang`, are expressions of the form

[.text-center]
`x \=> [x1{q1},x2{q2},x3{q3},...,xn{qn}]`

where `qi` is a _quantifier_ (coefficient), `xi` is a _type_ (indeterminate), `xi{qi}` is a quantified type (term), and the type are linearly combined via `[,]` (addition).
Instead of the terms being raised to a power (as is typical of numeric polynomials), `,-poly` terms are "raised" to a type with instructions.
This is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object[type exponentiation] which is the type-equivalent of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation[numeric exponentiation].

The aforementioned polynomial \$f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\$ is denoted in mm-ADT by the following `int\<=int` type.

[exec]
----
int => [int[id]{2},int[mult,int]{3},int[mult,[mult,int]]{6}][sum]
----

In \$f\$, addition and multiplication is with respects to the integer ring \$(\mathbb{Z},+,\ast,0,1)\$.
In `,-poly`, they are with respects to the stream ring, where multiplication is \$\Delta\$ and addition is \$\nabla\$.
The mm-ADT `,-poly` is a generalized algebraic structure known as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ring] that, when used to solve `int` based polynomials, the instructions `[mult]` and `[sum]` are required, where `int\<=int` type is reducible when the domain `int` is determined.

[exec]
----
4 => [int[id]{2},int[mult,int]{3},int[mult,[mult,int]]{6}]

image::poly-columns.svg[float=left,width=275]

The suggestive illustration on the left depicts a single element of some (free) ring.
There are four multiplicative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoid] compositions diagrammed as vertical chains rooted at an \$a\$.
There is single additive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group[abelian group] element diagrammed horizontally, reflecting a (commutative) linear combination of the monoid elements.
As 1-dimensional horizontal and vertical structures, each depicts an element of a free magma (group or monoid), where 0-dimensional elements would be drawn from a non-free algebra.
Thus, the illustration contains

. four *free monoid* elements -- `(a;b;c)`, `(a;d)`, `(a;b;e)`, `(a;d;e;b)`, and
. one *free group* element -- `\((a;b;c),(a;d),(a;b;e),(a;d;e;b))`,

where, in relation to `poly`, the illustration's `*` is denoted `;` and `+` is denoted `,`.

Each mm-ADT `poly` constrains the general construction of the illustration such that one magma remain free (*unevalated*) and the other non-free (*evaluated*).
In particular, as a classic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ring], a `,-poly` maintains a *free additive group* composed of isolated *non-free multiplicative monoids*.
Thus, with respects to the illustration, the vertical \$\ast\$-compositions are "collapsed" yielding four terms (`objs`) that are unable to merge horizontally due to the free nature of the additive group.
Thus, the `,-poly` is suggestively illustrated as

image::comma-poly-example.png[width=350,align=center]

and specified in `mmlang` as

[.text-center]
`(abc{q0},ad{q1},abe{q2},adeb{q3})`.

NOTE: For visual simplicity, quantifiers are not illustrated.
Furthermore, the reason that every term of the multiplicative monoid only has a single quantifier is due to the _universal commutativity of coefficients theorem_ of https://zenodo.org/record/2565243[stream ring theory].

A `,-poly` (pronounced "comma poly") is a classic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ring] composed of a free additive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group[abelian group] and a non-free multiplicative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoid].
If \$a,b \in \tt{object}\$ and \$q_0, q_1 \in \tt{q}\$ are elements comprising `obj` products, then the additive operator of the `obj` stream ring is defined as \[
[a_{q_0},b_{q_1}] = \begin{cases}
[a_{q_0+q_1}]     & \text{if } a==b, \\
[a_{q_0},b_{q_1}] & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}
\]

where \$[a_{q_0},b_{q_1}] \equiv ◊(a_{q_0},b_{q_1}) \equiv \nabla(\Delta(a_{q_0},b_{q_1})) \$ and \$+\$ denotes the respective quantifier ring's additive operator.
Given the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property[commutative] nature of the `,-poly` abelian group, the terms can be rearranged.
In https://zenodo.org/record/2565243[stream ring theory], this equality is known as the *bulking axiom* and it is of fundamental importance to efficient stream-based computing with benefits realized in both the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff[time and space] dimensions.

When applying \$x \in \tt{obj}\$, the `,-poly` group is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action[right action] on \$x\$ satisfying the equation below.
As an algebraic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)[module], \$x\$ is an element of the right `,-poly` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)[module] `obj` realizing a generalized form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication[scalar multiplication].

\[
x_{q_2}[a_{q_0},b_{q_1}] = \begin{cases}
[{xa}_{q_2*(q_0+q_1)}]            & \text{if } a==b, \\
[{xa}_{q_2*q_0},{xb}_{q_2*q_1}] & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}

The two https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)[magmas] of `;-poly` (pronounced "semi poly") are the free and non-free forms of the `obj` stream ring's multiplicative monoid.
The terms of `;-poly` _geometrically_ combined using the multiplicative operator \$=>\$ (denoted `;` in `poly`).
A `;-poly` is a partially commutative monoid known as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_monoid[trace monoid].
If \$a,b,x \in \tt{objects}\$ and \$q_0,q_1,q_2 \in \tt{q}\$, \$◊(a;b) \equiv [a;b]\$, then the `;-poly` \$(a_{q_0} ; b_{q_1})\$ acts on \$x_{q_2}\$ as



\[
[ a_{q\_0} ; b_{q\_1} ](x_{q\_2}) = b(a(x))_{ q_2 * q_0 * q_1 }.
\]

Of particular interest, when not merging (\$\nabla\$),

\[
\Delta(x_{q\_2}, (a_{q\_0} ; b_{q\_1})) = ( a(x)_{ q_2 * q_0 } ; b(a(x))_{ q_2 * q_0 * q_1 } ).
\]

image:bubble-chamber.png[width=200,float=left] The equation above realizes a structure and process joyfully named the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber["bubble chamber"].
In experimental higher-energy physics, a bubble chamber is small room filled with high pressure vapor.
Particles are shot into the room and the trace they leave (called their _varpor trail_) provides physicists information that they then used to understand the nature of the particle under study -- e.g., its mass, velocity, spin, and, when capturing decay, the sub-atomic particles that compose it.
In mm-ADT, \$x\$ above (and 5 below) play the role of the _particle_ and `;-poly` the _bubble chamber_ with each term in the `;-poly` acting as a _vapor droplet_.

A `|-poly` (pronounced "pipe poly") uses `|` as the `obj` term separator.
Like the `,-poly`, a `|-poly` maintains a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_group[free additive group] and a non-free multiplicative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoid].
However, unlike `,-poly`, the additive group is not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property[commutative].
If \$a,b,x \in \tt{objects}\$ and \$q_0,q_1,q_2 \in \tt{q}\$, then `|-poly` \$[a_{q_0} | b_{q_1}]\$ acts on \$x_{q_2}\$ as

\[
x_{q_2} [a_{q_0} | b_{q_1}] = \begin{cases}
{xa}_{q_2 * q_0} & \text{if } x_{q_2} a_{q_0} \neq \bf{0}, \\
{bx}_{q_2 * q_1} & \text{if } x_{q_2} b_{q_1} \neq \bf{0}, \\ \bf{0} & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

Thus, while `,-lst` implements link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)[union], `|-lst` implements https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator[null coalescing], where in mm-ADT, _null_ is `obj{0}` (the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_element[zero element] of the `obj` stream ring -- \$\mathbf{0}\$).
Like coalesce, the order in which the terms/branches are evaluated determines the result of the computation.
This is the reason that the additive group of `|-lst` (and `|-poly` in general) is not commutative.

----
<1> The first term applied to `x` is not `obj{0}` so `'a'` is added to `'x'`.
The polynomial reduces to `[plus,'a']{3}`.
<2> The first term applied to `x` is `obj{0}` and the second is not so `'b'` is added to `'x'`.
The polynomial reduces to `[plus,'b']{4}`.
<3> Both terms, when applied to `x` yield `obj{0}`.
The polynomial reduces to `obj{0}`.

`|-rec` enables link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28mathematical_logic%29[predicate]-based coalescing which is a form of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)[conditional branching] realized in most programming languages as link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#If-then-(else)_statements[if/else] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement[switch/case] branching.
While predicate-based branching is a function of \$\mathbb{B}\$ (`bool`), in mm-ADT it is determined by \$\tt{q}\$ (`{q}`), where __false__ is `obj{0}` (\$\mathbf{0}\$) and __true__ is any non-zero quantifier.
The non-commutative additive group of `|-poly`, as inherited by `|-rec`, realizes link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#Case_and_switch_statements[case-based] link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#Pattern_matching[pattern matching] branch ordering semantics.
Thus, if \$a,b,c,d,x \in \tt{objects}\$ and \$q_i \in \tt{q}\$, then

\[
x_{q_4} [a_{q_0} \to b_{q_1}  | c_{q_2} \to d_{q_3}] = \begin{cases}
{xb}_{q_4 * q_1} & \text{if } x_{q_4} a_{q_0} \neq \bf{0}, \\
{xd}_{q_4 * q_3} & \text{if } x_{q_4} c_{q_2} \neq \bf{0}, \\ \bf{0} & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}

'x'{2}[+{0}'a' -> +{4}'b' | +{0}'c' -> +{6}'d']
----

The previous `mmlang` examples are contrived.
In practice, they keys of `|-rec` will typically leverage `[is,bool]` with the anonymous type `_` serving as the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement#Fallthrough[default case] of the switch.

The above expression denotes a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ring] whose linearly combined terms are elements of the multiplicative monoid.
With abuse of notation, the expression below binds the monoidal terms with `+` to emphasize the prototypical polynomial form \$q_0 x^0 + q_1x^1 + q_2x^2\$.

\[
\texttt{int+2[is>0]\*5<44} \;\;+\;\; \texttt{int+2[is>0]*-6<44} \;\;+\;\; \texttt{int+2[is>0]*10+7<44} \]

Rings support both left and right https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property[distributivity] such that the following derivation yields the respective equivalence.

\[
\begin{split}
abcg + abdg + abefg &= a \ast (bcg + bdg + befg) \\ &= a \ast b \ast (cg + dg + efg) \\ &= a \ast b \ast (c + d + ef) \ast g \\ \end{split}
\]

Polynomials are the subject of interest primarily because they contain both multiplication and addition and, through derivations, multiplication can be translated to addition and addition to multiplication.
For instance, the left hand side of the the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_(polynomial)[binomial] below is the serial composition of two parallel branches while the right hand side is the parallelization of 4 serial compositions.

A non-free element is a _zero_-dimensional point.
A free element is a _one_-dimensional line.
The carrier set of the *type ringoid* is formed from the union of the elements of `obj` stream ring's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_abelian_group[free additive abelian group] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_monoid[free multiplicative monoid].
This is the _freest_ possible stream ring representation -- a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_algebra[free ring].
With two free magmas, the type ringoid's elements are _two_-dimensional planes.
One dimension represents multiplication and the other addition.
The type ringoid is encoded in `mmlang` as a `,-lst` (additive) with zero or more `;-lst` (multiplicative) terms.
The unfactored type from the previous section is presented, followed by its two-dimensional encoding as an element of the type ringoid.

The linear algebraic type ringoid compartmentalizes the type induced at the individual instruction-level.
This is the _absolutely_ freest representation of a ring(oid).
This "cellular form" is well suited to manipulation by the processor.
At compile-time, factoring a matrix representation can be leveraged for optimization and rewriting.
At evaluation runtime, the free type ringoid provides a deconstructed, 2-dimensional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline[pipeline] architecture that can be partitioned across machines of a cluster and/or threads of a machine.

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property[universal property] of monoid mappings is realized as the "lifted" `poly` syntactic encoding of an mm-ADT type.
