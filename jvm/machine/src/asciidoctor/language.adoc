== Language Structures

Every mm-ADT program denotes a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function[unary function] that maps an `obj` of type \$S\$ (start) to an `obj` of type \$E\$ (end) with the function signature

\[
f: S \rightarrow E.
\]

The complexities of mm-ADT are realized in the definition of an `obj` (which includes both types and values) and the internal structure of an \$f\$-program (which is a composition of nested-functions of arbitrary arity that are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying[curried] at either compile-time or runtime). The sole purpose of this documentation is to make salient the various algebraic structures that are operationalized to ultimately yield \$f : S \rightarrow E\$.

.Products and Coproducts
****
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory[Category theory] is the study of structure via manipulations that expose (or generate) other structures. Two important category theoretic concepts used throughout this section are *products* and *coproducts*.

image::product.png[float="left",width=225]

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)[product] is any object defined in terms of it's accessible component objects.
That is, from a single object, via \$\pi_n\$ projection morphisms, the product is decomposed into it's constituent parts.

image::coproduct.png[float="right",width=225]

A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct[coproduct] is any object defined in terms the component objects used to construct it.
That is, from many objects, via \$\iota_n\$ injection morphisms, a coproduct can be composed from constituent parts.

Along with these decomposition (and composition) morphisms, there exists an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism[isomorphism] between any two products (or coproducts) should they project (or inject) to the same component objects.
That is, product and coproduct equality are defined via component equality.
****

image::obj-type-value-q.png[role=left,padding-left=303,width=280]

Every mm-ADT `obj` is the product of

. An *object* co-product that is either a *type* or a *value* and
. A *quantifier* specifying the "amount" of objects being denoted.

\[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} + \texttt{value}) \times \texttt{q}.
\]

image::obj-type-q-value-q.png[float=right,width=450]

From this vantage point, mm-ADT's `obj` structure forms an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29[algebraic ring].
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29#Definition[ring axioms] specify how the elements of it's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure[carrier set] can be combined using the two binary operators \$\times\$ and \$\+\$ . One particular ring axiom states that products  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)#Distributivity[distribute] over co-products.
Thus, the previous formula can be rewritten as
\[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{q}) + (\texttt{value} \times \texttt{q}).
\]
This representation of `obj`, which is isomorphic to the previous, declares two kinds of mm-ADT `objs`: *quantified types* and *quantified values*. It is through a particular subset of `objs` called _instructions_ (\$ \tt{i\nst} \subset \tt{obj} \$) that types and values are linked to one another -- yielding the primary data structure used for all mm-ADT operations from compilation to execution: *the trace graph*.

Some example mm-ADT `objs` are presented below using `mmlang`.

It is through "_quantified objects_" that mm-ADT types and values, which are typically isolated structures in most programming runtime environments, are able to co-exist (within the same category).

* A type refers to values.
* A value is a type that only refers to itself.

From the unification of types and values, various seemingly disconnected aspects of computing blend together naturally. The particulars of these integrations (which are itemized below) will be discussed at length in respective forthcoming sections of this documentation.

=== Types

In the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#Difference_from_set_theory[set-theoretic interpretation of types], a type is a _set_ of values, where, for example, `int` denotes the set of all integer values \$n \in \mathbb{N}\$. In the mm-ADT interpretation of types, a type denotes a *stream* of values. A stream is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset[__multi-set__] (or bag) with the following properties:

* Streams can have values inserted and removed (like a collection).
* Streams do not preserve insert nor removal order (not like a queue).
* Streams may contain duplicate values (not like a set).

Every stream of values has a corresponding type that was constructed and it is through type construction that values are implicitly created (at compile-time) and explicitly enumerated (at runtime).

==== Type Structure

An `obj` was previously defined as \[
\texttt{obj} = (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{q}) + (\texttt{value} \times \texttt{q}).
\]

This definition specifies no internal structure to a type or value. If this definition was complete, then types and values would be isomorphic and thus, indistinguishable. This is not the case. mm-ADT types are a coproduct where every type is either a

image::type-product.png[float=right,width=295]

. *canonical type* (ctype): a base/fundamental type, or a
. *derived type* (dtype): a product of a type and an instruction (`inst`).

The ctypes are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system[nominal types] and the dtypes are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system[structural types] whose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type[recursive definition] is ultimately grounded in a ctype via a chain of instructions (`inst`) that operate on types to yield types. Formally, the type coproduct is defined as

\[\begin{split}
\texttt{type} &=\;& (\texttt{bool} + \texttt{int} + \texttt{real} + \texttt{str} + \texttt{rec})) + (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{inst})\\ \texttt{type} &=\;& \texttt{ctype} + (\texttt{type} \times \texttt{inst}) \\ \texttt{type} &=\;& \texttt{ctype} + \texttt{dtype},
\end{split}\]

where each component of the coproduct also has a respective quantifier as previously defined for `obj`: \$(\tt{object} \times \tt{q})\$.

A dtype has two \$pi\$-projections. The type projection denotes the _domain_ and the instruction projection denotes the _function_, where the type product as a whole, relative to the component projections, is the _range_.
\[
\begin{split}
\tt{type} &=\;& (\tt{type} &\;\times\;& \tt{inst}) &\;+\;& \tt{ctype} \\ \text{“range} &=\;& (\text{domain} &\;\text{and}\;& \text{function}) &\;\text{or}\;& \text{base"} \end{split}
\]

The implication of the dtype product is that mm-ADT types are generated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type[inductively] by applying instructions from the mm-ADT VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] (`inst`). The application of an `inst` to a type (ctype or dtype) yields a dtype that is a structural expansion of the previous type.

image::ctype-dtype.png[align=center,width=230]

For example, `int` is a ctype. When the instruction `[is>0]` is applied to `int`, the dtype `int[is>0]` is formed. In particular, this dtype is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type[refinement type] that denotes a single natural number in \$\mathbb{N}^+\$. In terms of the "__range = domain and function__" reading, when `int` (*domain*) is applied to `[is>0]` (*function*), the result is an integer greater than zero (*range*).

image::int_isgt0.png[align=center,width=260]

image::obj-full.png[float=right,width=320]

The full `obj` structure thus far is diagrammed on the right and some type construction examples are presented in `mmlang` on the left.

. *Type definition*: an instruction tree specifying type element enumeration (via the \$ \pi_\tt{i\nsts} \$ projection).

image::type-signature-definition.png[align=center,width=650]

===== Type Signatures

Every mm-ADT type can be generally understood as a function that maps an `obj` of one type to an `obj` of another (potentially equivalent) type. A *type signature* specifies the source and target of this mapping, where the "domain" is the source type and the "range" is the target type. Both the domain and range type specifications include a respective quantification denoted `{q}` in `mmlang`.

[cols="5,10"]
|===
|mmlang Expression |Description

a|
[source]
----
mmlang> int{1}
==>int
----
|In most programming languages, a value can be typed `int` as in `val x:int = 10`.
Such https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_(computer_programming)[declarations] state that the value referred to by `x` is a _single_ element within the set of integers. The concept of a "single element" is captured in mm-ADT via quantification, where a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(ring_theory)[unit] quantifier is not displayed in `mmlang`.

a|

----
mmlang> int<=int
==>int
----
|From the perspective of a function, An mm-ADT `int` is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)[no-op] on the set of integers. Given any integer, `int` returns that integer. In `mmlang`, when the domain and range are the same, the `<=` and repeated type are not displayed.

a|
[source]
----
mmlang> int<=bool
error: bool is not an int
----
|Without any instructions, there is no way for a type to legally map a `bool` to an `int`. Type's that are fully specified by their type signature are always canonical types. Said another way, the types' definitions are "no-ops."

a|
[source]
----
mmlang> int{5}
==>int{5}
----
|`int{5}` is a type referring to 5 integers (with repeats possible according to stream semantics). As a point of comparison, `int` denotes a stream containing a single integer. This is why `int` is syntactic sugar for `int{1}` in `mmlang`.

a|
[source]
----
mmlang> int{0,5}
==>int{0,5}
mmlang> int{0,5}<=int{0,5}
==>int{0,5}
----
|The quantifier ring can be any ring with unity. In the previous examples, the chosen quantifier was the integer ring \$\langle \mathbb{Z},+,\times \rangle\$. In this example, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure[carrier set] is two integers and represents uncertainty as to the number of elements being referred to. `int{0,5}` is a type referring to either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 integers.
|===

===== Type Definitions

mm-ADT type signatures specify the canonical type and quantity of the type's domain and range. Further specification of the nature of the elements of the type is accomplished via a *type definition*. The following mm-ADT type is known as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type[refinement type] because it provides further constraint/refinement on which particular integers in `int` the type is refering to.
This particular type is the mm-ADT definition of a natural number in \$\mathbb{N}\$.

\[
\tt{int[is,[gte,0]]} \equiv \mathbb{N}
\]

The structure `[is,[gte,0]]` is an *instruction* with a single argument. mm-ADT instruction opcodes denote specific operations explicitly implemented by the mm-ADT virtual machine.
The set of all mm-ADT instructions forms the machine's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] as well as the https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Ab-enriched+category[*instruction ringoid*] (w/ unity).

A type is transformed into another type via an instruction application.
Every instruction is able to operate on both types and values.
In this way, instruction application on types yields program _compilation_ and instruction application on values yields _evaluation_. The compilation of a type produces a type, where quantification and domain/range specifications are inferred when unspecified by the user.

<2> A compiled type that maps a single integer to zero or one integers. If the internal `bool\<=int[gte,0]` type yields
`true`, then an `int{1}`, else `int{0}`.
<3> A type operates on an `int` thus, if supplied "an `int` type", the type operates on it to yield a type. The use of types to process types is a form of compilation generally known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation[abstract interpretation].
<4> The type maps the positive integer `6{1}` to `6{1}` (_some_).
<5> The type maps the negative integer `-6{1}` to `-6{0}` (_none_).

==== Type Quantification

In order to quantify the _amount_ of objects in a stream, every mm-ADT type has an associated quantifier `q`. Quantifiers are typically integers, but are generally any element from an ordered algebraic ring (e.g. integers, reals in \$ \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^3, \ldots, \mathbb{R}^n \$, unitary matrices, etc.). Moreover, while integer quantifiers signify "amount," other quantifiers such as unitary matrices denoting a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function[quantum wave function], "amount" is a less accurate description of what a quantifier represents.

|===

All `mmlang` expressions within `{ }` operate on the mm-ADT VM's *_quantifier ring_* (w/ unity).
Any object that supports `+`/`*`/`0`/`1` and the axioms governing their composition can be used as an mm-ADT quantifier.
Along with Turing Complete types specifications, type definitions can be specified to as accurate or fuzzy a degree as computationally and conceptually possible.

Typically, the quantifier of choice for most applications is the `int` ring (or `int` range ring -- `{2,13}`).
Common programming concepts that are usually captured by typeclasses or functors (via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(mathematics)[lifting]) are expressed in mm-ADT via quantification.

[source]
----
int                                  // a single int   (some)
int{?}<=int[is,[gt,0]]               // 0 or 1 int     (option)
int{0}<=int[is,false]                // 0 ints         (none)
int{4}<=int{2}[branch,[id],[id]]     // 4 ints         (exact)
int{*}<=[=db][get,'costs']           // 0 or more ints (any)
----

NOTE: The default quantifier ring of the mm-ADT VM is \[
\langle \mathbb{N}^+ \times \mathbb{N}^+, \cdot, + \rangle, \]
where \$(1,1)\$ is the multiplicative identity (unity) and \$(0,0)\$ is the additive identity.
The \$\cdot\$ and \$ +\$ binary operators are pairwise integer multiplication and addition, respectively.
In `mmlang` if an `obj` quantifier is not displayed, then the quantifier is assumed to be the unity of the ring, or `{1,1}`.
Moreover, if a single value is provided, it is assumed to be repeated where `{n}` is shorthand for `{n,n}`.

=== The Instruction Set Architecture

==== The Inst Monoid

.Initial and Terminal Objects
****
image::initial.png[width=130,float=left]

A category may have an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects[initial and/or terminal] object.

An *initial object* \$S\$ is the domain of a set of morphism \$S \rightarrow E_n\$.
Initial objects, via their morphisms, generate all the objects of the category.
If there is an initial object, then it is unique in that if there is another initial object, it has the same diagrammatic topology -- all outgoing morphisms and no incoming morphisms save the identity.
Thus, besides labels, two initials are isomorphic.

image::terminal.png[width=130,float=right]
A *terminal object* \$E\$ is the range of a set of morphisms \$E \rightarrow S_n\$.
Terminal objects subsume all other objects in the category in that all other objects \$S_n\$ can be morphed into the terminal object, but the terminal object can not be morphed into any other object.
Similar to initials, should another terminal exist, the two terminal are isomorphic in that they both have the same number of incoming morphisms and no outgoing morphisms (save the identity).
****

image::initial-ctypes.png[float="right",width=275]

The initial object of the `inst` monoid is `obj{\*}`--from nothing, everything can be generated with the respective https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_morphism[constant morphism]/instruction.
A unique constant morphism exists from `obj{0}` to each of the 6 *canonical types*.
The corresponding instructions are `[bool]`, `[int]`, `[real]`, `[str]`, and `[rec]`, where, for example, \[
\texttt{[bool]}: \texttt{obj\{0\}} \rightarrow \texttt{bool}
\]
and in `mmlang` notation \[
\texttt{bool\<=[bool]} \]


image::type-product.png[float="right",width=250]
There are two kinds of mm-ADT types: *canonical types* (ctypes) and *derived types* (dtypes).
There are 6 ctypes which comprise the fundamental base types of the mm-ADT VM: `bool`, `int`, `real`, `str`, `lst`, or `rec`.
A dtype is the product of a type and an instruction (`inst`), where the type component serves as the _domain_, the instruction component the _function_, and the type product as a whole, relative to it's components, the _range_.

\[
\begin{split}
\tt{type} &=\;& (\tt{dtype} &\;*\;& \tt{inst}) &\;+\;& \tt{ctype} \\ \text{“range} &=\;& (\text{domain} &\;\text{and}\;& \text{function}) &\;\text{or}\;& \text{base"} \end{split}
\]

The dtypes are generated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type[inductively] by applying instructions from the mm-ADT VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] (`inst`).
When applied to types, every `inst` yields a distinct dtype that is a structural expansion of the previous type.

image::types.png[align=center,width=35%]

The dtype's recursive definition is grounded at the 6 ctypes, where every canonical type is it's own domain and range.

image::obj-full.png[float=right,width=300]

The example below demonstrates how instructions applied to types create new types.
The diagram on the right presents the products and co-products that form the general structure of the mm-ADT VM language (which is realized in mmlang).

==== The Instruction Monoid

.Monoids
****
A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[monoid] is a structure of the form \$\langleA,\ast\rangle\$, where \$A\$ is the carrier set closed under the associative binary operator \$\ast: A \times A \rightarrow A\$ with \$1 \in A\$ being the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element[identity] such that for every \$a,b,c \in A\$, \$(a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c)\$ and \$a \ast 1 = 1 \ast a = a\$.
****

image::inst-monoid.png[float="left",width=50]

mm-ADT types serve numerous roles which are typically realized by many different sorts of objects in traditional programmable systems.
The reason for this singular use is quite literally because the mm-ADT type system (and value system) is inductively generated from the mm-ADT VM's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture] which is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(mathematics)[generator set] of the _syntactic_ **inst monoid** \[
\langle\texttt{inst},\ast\rangle, \]
where \$\tt{i\nst}\$ is the infinite set of all instruction compositions, \$\ast: \tt{i\nst} \times \tt{i\nst} \rightarrow \tt{i\nst}\$ an associative binary composition operator, and \$\tt{[no\op]} \in \tt{i\nst}\$ is unique identity element.

An mm-ADT instruction is a ordered list of `objs` where the first element is the opcode and all subsequent elements are instruction arguments.
For instance, `[plus,6]` is an instruction where `plus` is the opcode and `6` is the argument.
Instructions can be composed to create longer instruction chains.

\[
\begin{split}
\texttt{[plus,4]} &=\;& \texttt{[plus,4]} \\ \texttt{[plus,4][mult,2]} &=\;& \texttt{[plus,4]} * \texttt{[mult,2]} \\ \texttt{[plus,4][mult,2][gt,42]} &=\;& \texttt{[plus,4][mult,2]} * \texttt{[gt,42]} \\ \end{split}
\]

The instruction monoid is the algebraic structure used by `mmlang` to enable users to write expression.
The mm-ADT VM processes types, which while composed of instructions (\$ \tt{type} = (\tt{type} \times \tt{i\nst})\$) are not instructions.
There exists an isomorphism (a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_and_faithful_functors[bijective functor]) that maps the `inst` syntactic monoid to the type graph monoid.
This should not a surprising bijection--it proves that the syntax of `mmlang` is sufficient to express every possible mm-ADT type and vice versa, every mm-ADT type has a corresponding expression in `mmlang`.

image::inst-type-functor.png[width=35%,align=center]


==== Type Ring

mm-ADT's type theory has a rich axiomatic semantics founded on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory[algebraic ring theory] and in particular, on https://zenodo.org/record/2565243[stream ring theory].

NOTE: In stream ring theory, instructions are called _functions_ and quantifiers are called _coefficients_.
A function-coefficient pair is called a _stream_.
The equivalence highlights the fact that mm-ADT types refer to streams of objects (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset[multi-sets] or bags).

In ring theory, if \$<A,+,\ast>\$ is a ring with \$A\$ the carrier set, \$0 \in A\$ the additive identity, \$1 \in A\$ the multiplicative identity, and \$a,b,c \in A\$, then the ring must obey the axioms itemized on the left.
Every ring benefits from the theorems itemized on the right which are (the most popularly used) logical entailments of the axioms.

&nbsp;

The type system of mm-ADT is characterized by a particular formulation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_ring[direct product of rings] over the _quantifier_ and _instruction_ rings (discussed next).
The product of these two rings is a ring itself called the _stream ring_.
Thus, mm-ADT's types are founded on ring theory in general and stream ring theory in particular.

image::ring-structures.png[align="center",width=80%]

NOTE: Instructions and quantifiers are the carrier sets of two independent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)[rings] with unity whose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product[direct product] forms the mm-ADT type ring and is the subject of study in https://zenodo.org/record/2565243[stream ring theory] (SRT).
The type graph structure presented previously is a subgraph of a (pseudo) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph[Cayley graph] formed from the multiplicative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)[monoid] (w/ no multiplicative inverse) component of that ring.

====== The Instruction Ring

In mm-ADT, the carrier set of the *instruction ring* is the set of all instructions, where

* `inst` is the carrier set,
* `*` is serial composition,
* `+` is parallel composition,
* `0` is `[none]` and
* `1` is `[all]`.

In the table below `[a]`, `[b]`, and `[c]` are variable instructions in `inst`, where `[none] == [is,false]` and `[all] == [is,true]`.

IMPORTANT: A known "bug" in stream ring theory is that not all instructions in `inst` have an additive inverse.
Thus, it is not the case that every instruction set can serve as the carrier of a ring.
Fortunately, in the larger composite type ring (discussed later), which forms the primary algebraic structure in mm-ADT's type system, the quantifier ring's multiplicative inverse can be used to remedy the situation--see the 3rd entry in the table above.

As an example, the instructions `[plus,10]` and `[gt,5]` can be combined via serial and/or parallel composition.
In general, all serial and parallel compositions are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property[associative] except for those that use instructions from a particular `inst` subring known as the _the reduce near-ring_ (discussed later).

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property[distributivity] of multiplications over addition is made apparent with expressions below which have a diagrammatic representation, where the edges/arrows are streams of `objs` that are being operated on by the `insts` vertex/objects they meet along the way.
Whenever the diagram branches, the `obj` at the branch is cloned, taking _both_ branches.

\[
\texttt{x[branch,[a],[b]]} = \uplus <\texttt{x[a]},\texttt{x[b]}> \]
