http://mm-adt.org[mm-ADT] is a dual licensed https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt[AGPL3]/commercial open source project that offers software engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and others in the software industry a royalty-based OSS model. The Turing Complete mm-ADT virtual machine (VM) integrates disparate data technologies via algebraic composition, yielding _synthetic data systems_  tailored to the computational requirements of a problem. As an economic model, each integration point offers the respective development team access to the revenue streams generated by any for-profit organization leveraging mm-ADT.

The mm-ADT VM is the integration point for the following data processing technologies:

* *Programming Languages*: Language designers can create custom languages or develop parsers for existing languages that compile to mm-ADT VM bytecode (binary machine code) or unicode (text assembly code).
* *Storage Systems*: Storage engineers can embed their systems using _model-ADT_ functors expressed in mm-ADT's dependent type system that enable the lossless encoding of key/value store, document store, wide-column store, graph store, relational store, and other novel or hybrid structures such as hypergraph, docu-graph, and quantum data structures.
* *Processing Engines*: Processor developers enable their push- or pull-based execution engines to be programmed by any mm-ADT language for evaluation via mm-ADT's abstract execution model of atomic monadic traversers diffusing themselves over storage data structure via single-machine, multi-threaded, agent-based, distributed near-time, and/or cluster-oriented, batch-analytic processors.


The mm-ADT VM enables the intermingling of any language, any storage system, and any processor that can faithfully implement the core language semantics (types and values), storage semantics (streams of atomic and composite data structures), and/or processor semantics (monadic traversers up to the limits of the expressiveness of the components themselves.

=== The mm-ADT Console

The mm-ADT VM provides a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop:[REPL] console for users to evaluate mm-ADT programs written in any mm-ADT language. The reference language distributed with the VM is called `mmlang`. `mmlang` is a low-level, functional language that is in near 1-to-1 correspondence with the underlying VM architecture -- offering it's users https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness[Turing-Complete] expressively when writing programs and an interactive teaching tool for studying the internal structures and processes of the mm-ADT VM.
