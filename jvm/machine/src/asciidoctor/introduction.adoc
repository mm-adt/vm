http://mm-adt.org[mm-ADT] is a dual licensed https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt[AGPL3]/commercial open source project that offers software engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and others in the software industry a royalty-based OSS model. The Turing Complete mm-ADT virtual machine (VM) integrates disparate data technologies via algebraic composition, yielding _synthetic data systems_ tailored problem's computational requirements. As an economic model, each integration point offers the respective development team access to the revenue streams generated by any for-profit organization leveraging mm-ADT.

The mm-ADT VM is the integration point for the following data processing technologies:

* *Programming Languages*: Language designers can create custom languages or develop parsers for existing languages that compile to mm-ADT VM bytecode (binary machine code) or unicode (text assembly code).
* *Storage Systems*: Storage engineers can embed their systems using _model-ADT_ functors expressed in mm-ADT's dependent type system that enable the lossless encoding of key/value store, document store, wide-column store, graph store, relational store, and other novel or hybrid structures such as hypergraph, docu-graph, and quantum data structures.
* *Processing Engines*: Processor developers enable their push- or pull-based execution engines to be programmed by any mm-ADT language for evaluation via mm-ADT's abstract execution model for processing data structures via single-machine, multi-threaded, agent-based, distributed near-time, and/or cluster-oriented, batch-analytic processors.

The mm-ADT VM enables the intermingling of any language, any storage system, and any processor that can faithfully implement the core language semantics (__types and values__), storage semantics (__data structure streams__), and/or processor semantics (__process trace graphs__) up to the limits of the expressiveness of the components themselves.


=== The mm-ADT Console

The mm-ADT VM provides a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop:[REPL] console for users to evaluate mm-ADT programs written in any mm-ADT language. The reference language distributed with the VM is called `mmlang`. `mmlang` is a low-level, functional language that is in near 1-to-1 correspondence with the underlying VM architecture -- offering it's users https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness[Turing-Complete] expressively when writing programs and an interactive teaching tool for studying the mm-ADT VM.
