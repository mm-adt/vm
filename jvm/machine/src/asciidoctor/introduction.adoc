http://mm-adt.org[mm-ADT] is a dual licensed https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt[AGPL3]/commercial open source project that offers software engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and others in the software industry a royalty-based OSS model.
The Turing Complete mm-ADT virtual machine (VM) integrates disparate data technologies via algebraic composition, yielding _synthetic data systems_ that have the requisite computational power and expressivity for the problems they were designed to solve.
As an economic model, each integration point offers the respective development team access to the revenue streams generated by any for-profit organization leveraging mm-ADT.

The mm-ADT VM integrates the following data processing technologies:

* *Programming Languages*: Language designers can create custom languages or develop parsers for existing languages that compile to mm-ADT VM assembly code (`mmlang`) or bytecode (binary encoding of `mmlang`).
* *Processing Engines*: Processor developers can enable their push- or pull-based execution engines to be programmed by any mm-ADT language. The abstract processing model supports single-machine, multi-threaded, agent-based, distributed near-time, and/or cluster-oriented, batch-analytic processors.
* *Storage Systems*: Storage engineers can expose their systems via _model-ADTs_ expressed in mm-ADT's dependent type system that enable the lossless encoding of key/value store, document store, wide-column store, graph store, relational store, and other novel or hybrid structures such as hypergraph, docu-graph, and quantum data structures.

The mm-ADT VM enables the intermingling of any language, any processor, and any storage system that can faithfully implement the core language semantics (__types and values__), processor semantics (__instruction set architecture__), and/or storage semantics (__data structure streams__).

=== mm-ADT Theory

==== mm-ADT Function

Every mm-ADT program denotes a single https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_function[unary function] that maps an `obj` of type \$S\$ (start) to an `obj` of type \$E\$ (end) with the function signature

\[
f: S \rightarrow E.
\]

The complexities of mm-ADT are realized in the definition of an `obj` (which includes both types and values) and the internal structure of an \$f\$-program (which is a composition of nested https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying[curried] functions). The sole purpose of this documentation is to make salient the various algebraic structures that are operationalized to ultimately yield the mapping \$f : S \rightarrow E\$.

==== mm-ADT Algebras

****
There are two operations: addition (\$ +\$) and multiplication (\$\ast\$). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra[Abstract algebra] is the study of these two operations across a wide range of slightly different generalized https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure[structures] devoid of considerations regarding the particulars of their implementation: integers, digital circuits, quantum systems in a superposition, etc. Theoreticians deduce https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem[theorems] based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom[axioms] of the structures and experimentalists apply the structural patterns to other systems, real or designed.

The pedagogical masterpiece of the discipline is the *magma hiearchy*.

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_%28algebra%29[Magma] \$(A,\ast)\$: a set \$A\$ with a potentially associative binary operator \$ast: A \times A \to A\$.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup[Semigroup] \$(A,\ast)\$: a magma with an associative binary operator \$(a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c)\$.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid[Monoid] \$(A,\ast,\mathbf{1})\$: a semigroup with an identity element such that \$a \ast \mathbf{1} = a = \mathbf{1} \ast a\$.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)[Group] \$(A,\ast,\mathbf{1})\$: a monoid with ever element having an inverse such that \$a \ast a^{-1} = \mathbf{1} = a^{-1} \ast a\$.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)[Ring] \$(A,+,\ast,\mathbf{0},\mathbf{1})\$: a \$ +\$-group and a \$\ast\$-monoid bound by distributivity, \$a \ast (b + c) = (a \ast b) + (a \ast c)\$.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)[Field] \$(A,+,\ast,\mathbf{0},\mathbf{1})\$: a ring where the \$\ast\$-monoid is a \$\ast\$-group.

Numerous _enrichments_ to these structures blur the sharp lines that divide them.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property[Abelian] \$a \cdot b=b \cdot a\$: the binary operator is agnostic to the order of the arguments.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence[Idempotent] \$a \cdot a = a\$: the binary operator reaches a fixpoint on self compositions.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_algebra[Free] \$A^\ast\$: the binary operator is replaced with _concatenation_ to record operation sequences, not evaluate them.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)[Module] \$A[x]\$: a binary magma that respects the abstract form of linear algebra via _scalars_ and _vectors_.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[Polynomial] \$x_1a + x_2a^2 + \ldots + x_na^n\$: a binary magma with free addition and non-free multiplication.
* ...

No one practitioner will ever have a complete grasp of the intricacies that bind \$ +\$ and \$\ast\$ together over \$A\$.

The base algebra of mm-ADT is a type-oriented ring algebra called the *obj stream ring*. There are three surjective https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism[homomorphisms] yielding the three algebras of the aforementioned components.  The *language algebra*'s (`inst` monoid) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_monoid[free monoid] enables the nested, serial composition of parameterized instructions (`inst`) from the mm-ADT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture[instruction set architecture]. The *processor algebra* (type ringoid) is a free https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring[polynomial ringoid] (`poly`) for the compilation and evaluation of mm-ADT types (or programs). The *storage algebra*  (`obj` magma) is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)[magma] with a carrier set containing all mm-ADT objects (`obj`) and a partially https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property[associative], binary operator for constructing data streams.

These component algebras represent the particular perspective that each component has on a shared data structure known as the *obj graph* which realizes _a ringoid-embedded monoidal Cayley graph_. This https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)[graph] is the medium by which https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action[algebraic actions] effectively couple these components over the course of a computation: specification, compilation, and evaluation.

The primary purpose of this documentation is to explain these algebras, specify their relationship to one another and demonstrate how they are manipulated by mm-ADT technologies. Data system engineers will learn how to integrate their technology so end users may compose their efforts with others' to create _synthetic data systems_ tailored to a problem's particular computational requirements.

=== mm-ADT Technology

==== mm-ADT Console

The mm-ADT VM provides a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop:[REPL] console for users to evaluate mm-ADT programs written in any mm-ADT language.
The reference language distributed with the VM is called `mmlang`. `mmlang` is a low-level, functional language that is in near 1-to-1 correspondence with the underlying VM architecture -- offering it's users https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness[Turing-Complete] expressivity when writing programs and an interactive teaching tool for studying the mm-ADT VM.
